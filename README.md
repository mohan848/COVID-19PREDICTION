## COVID-19 PREDICTION using chest X-Rays

After successfully creating a model with high accuracy, we created a web interface where user (Health Care Worker) will upload images of the chest X-ray and it will provide outcome as a label like infected from the disease or not and also store the details in a database for future reference.
